# 🚀 Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

Implemented from scratch using NumPy:
• Linear Regression
• Logistic Regression
• K-Means Clustering
• Evaluation Metrics

This repository contains implementations of fundamental Machine Learning algorithms built completely from scratch using Python and NumPy — without using high-level ML libraries like Scikit-Learn for training.

The goal of this project is to deeply understand the mathematical foundations and inner working of ML algorithms.
